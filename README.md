# udacity nanodegree react project .

This project is a book website in a form of a list, I use a books API that contains information about books (name, book cover, etc) my website uses this information to build a book container.

# Home page

the home page contains three shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read) also the user can move a book from one shelf to another.

# Serach page

I build a search page to search for the data that comes from the book API by entering a word in the search box
